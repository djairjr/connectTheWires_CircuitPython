# Connect The Wires - Nicolau dos Brinquedos Version of this beautifull puzzle:

In my version of this puzzle, I added some distinct elements. 
There are nine plugs and only four distinct connections, which are random with each system reboot. 
My system has no LEDs at the ends of the cables. 
But I used an analog VU and a Neopixel ring to give the game progress indication. 
In the Circuitpython version I use a PCF8575 module to create a system with 16 plugs and only four correct connections.

I think it's not hard to find the right connections of circuit board by reading python code.
